            That quote is from a Spanish rapper named AMBKOR and it still resonates in every corner of my soul and
            mind.
            I started studying coding with Udemy, but I soon realized I needed feedback from experts and the
            opportunity
            to connect with a community of like-minded peers. Therefore, I decided to enroll as a bootcamp student
            in the
            Frontend Developer Career Path. This journal captures some of the experiences I've had on this
            incredible learning journey.</p>

            <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p>It's all about the big goal. I want to become a professional developer, and that's my goal. 
                It's said that discipline defeats motivation, so no matter how busy I am, it's crucial to do something every day. 
                Another significant aspect is accountability, and that's one of the reasons I enrolled in Scrimba's bootcamp.

            <h2>How I got Started</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in the realm of my workplace, a weariness began to settle within me. 
                I grew tired of the repetitive tasks, the manual labor involved in managing inventories and analyzing data. 
                It was a monotonous routine that left me yearning for something more.
                In my quest for a solution, I turned to the reliable aid of Excel spreadsheets. 
                They offered a glimmer of hope, allowing me to semi-automate the cumbersome process of data input. 
                As I delved into this realm of organized cells and formulas, a flicker of inspiration reignited within me—a spark I had thought had long faded away.
                It was then that I rediscovered my true passion—the joy of building and problem-solving. 
                This newfound revelation became the catalyst that propelled me forward. With renewed determination, 
                I made a resolute decision—to invest my energy and embrace the path of becoming a professional web developer. 
                And so, the next chapter of my story began, fueled by the flames of passion and a deep desire to forge a new 
                future in the world of web development.

            <p class="blog-body">I've decided to come back to one of my passion, which is coding. I went from studying
                at UDEMY with DR. Angela Yu
