        <h1> My journey as Front End Developer / productor</h1>
        <p>Dream while you're awake because when you're sleeping, you don't get to choose your dreams. 
            That quote is from a Spanish rapper named AMBKOR and it still resonates in every corner of my soul and mind.
            I started studying coding with Udemy, but I soon realized I needed feedback from experts and the opportunity 
            to connect with a community of like-minded peers. Therefore, I decided to enroll as a bootcamp student in the 
            Frontend Developer Career Path. This journal captures some of the experiences I've had on this incredible learning journey.

                I'm beginning to visualize the big picture of where I want to go. Having this dream is like a lighthouse, no matter
                how many storms are in the path, this will keep me on track
