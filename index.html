            <p class="white">Dream while you're awake because when you're sleeping, you don't get to choose your dreams.
                That quote is from a Spanish rapper named AMBKOR and it still resonates in every corner of my soul and
                mind.
                I started studying coding with Udemy, but I soon realized I needed feedback from experts and the
                opportunity
                to connect with a community of like-minded peers. Therefore, I decided to enroll as a bootcamp student
                in the
                Frontend Developer Career Path. This journal captures some of the experiences I've had on this
                incredible learning journey.

            <p class="blog-body">I've decided to come back to one of my passion, which is coding. I went from studying
                at UDEMY with DR. Angela Yu
                into enrolling as a bootcamp student at Scrimba

            <p class="blog-body">It's amazing how so soon I have start to build easy apps, such as a scoreboard.
                Being able to actually see and challenge myself is giving me the energy and motivation I need to
                continue in this journey

            <p class="blog-body">Today I'm finishing the advance JS module on Scrimba and just like I do each time I'm
                producing a song
                I'm beginning to visualize the big picture of where I want to go. Having this dream is like a
                lighthouse, no matter
                how many storms are in the path, this will keep me on track
